#What I learned today

testing to sync

**Day1**
1. **differnce between `GUI` and `CLI`** 
`GUI` Graphical User Interface -> easy to use, especially for berginners, but less efficient and slow
`CLI` Command Line Interface -> fast and efficient, you can chain commands and automate, but not that beginner friendly

2. **Linux commands**
`pwd` for current path working directory
`cd` for chaning the working directory
`mv` for moving a directory
`mkdir` for creating a directory
`ls` for listing files in a directory
`cp` for copying files
`*` to select everything with something
`rm` for removing files
`rm -r []/` for removing directories
`cat` for editing files, `cat >` for overwrite something, `cat >>` for adding something

*tab* to autofil

3. **bash script**
* difference in `$HOME` and `$WORK` -> only work in `$WORK`
* Terminal: `sbatch` to upload, `squeue` to see how long it takes, if it isn't already finished 
* Script: *strg+s* to safe it
* Loops in bash script
* `#` to create comments
